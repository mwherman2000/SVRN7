The Web 7.0 Decentralized System Architecture (DSA) is a sovereign, DID-native, DIDComm-native runtime for digital participation. Every participant in the Web 7.0 ecosystem operates a **Trusted Digital Assistant (TDA)** — a personal or institutional software agent that holds identity, manages value, communicates exclusively over end-to-end encrypted DIDComm channels, and participates in **Verifiable Trust Circles (VTC7)** — federated peer meshes in which identity and trust are cryptographic properties, not institutional ones.

This repository is the Epoch 0 (Endowment Phase) reference implementation of the Web 7.0 DSA, specified by the DSA 0.24 diagram using the Parchment Programming Modeling Language (PPML). It includes the TDA Host runtime, all eleven standard LOBE modules, the SOVRONA (SVRN7) Shared Reserve Currency (SRC) library, and fifteen IETF draft specifications.

Excerpt from April 17, 2026 memo: _Web 7.0: Killer Application for the Internet_:

> With every passing second, a new autonomous digital agent comes online. A new decentralized identity (DID) is generated every few minutes. In 2025, more than 300 books appeared on the topic of AI agents, sovereign identity, and decentralized trust — and over 14,000 technical articles flooded arXiv, GitHub, and the standards bodies. You cannot attend a technology conference without encountering the phrase “agent economy.” 

>J. [Allard], more than 32 years have passed since you wrote the _Windows: The Next Killer Application on the Internet memo (January 25, 1994)_. Now, the Internet is experiencing a revolutionary tidal wave: Web 7.0, a replacement for the World Wide Web (and Windows) that is open, sovereign, secure, and decentralized.

>> _Rule Change 1: Web 7.0 is profoundly aligned with the oldest promise of the Internet: secure, trusted, universal access to information, services, and liquidity—for every human and digital agent on the planet—with no gatekeepers or overlords._

> This memo summarizes the core technologies, identifies the strategic opportunity, and describes what it will take to make Web 7.0 the killer application for the Internet. The three fundamental building blocks of Web 7.0 include:
> - sovereign identity, 
> - cryptographically verifiable authenticity, and
> - secure, trusted, autonomous communication.
> Collectively, I refer to these pillars as Web 7.0 Decentralized Library Operating System (Web 7.0 DIDLibOS™) or simply, Web 7.0™.

>> _Rule Change 2: Whoever succeeds in establishing the global Decentralized System Architecture (DSA) standards and reference implementations will occupy the same position Microsoft occupied in 1994 relative to the Internet — except this time, the platform is open, the identity is sovereign, and the shared reserve currency is governed by (non-blockchain) cryptographic proof._

## 1. What is the Web 7.0 DSA?

The Web 7.0 Decentralized System Architecture is a design framework and reference
implementation for sovereign digital participation. Its governing premise is that **identity
precedes participation** — every action in the system is taken by a DID holder, every
entitlement is a Verifiable Credential, and trust between parties is established by
cryptographic proof, not by institutional authority.

The DSA has five structural layers:

```
+--------------------------------------------------------------+
|  VTC7 Mesh  — Verifiable Trust Circles                       |
|  Federated peer TDAs; DIDComm-native; no central broker      |
+--------------------------------------------------------------+
|  TDA  — Trusted Digital Assistant                            |
|  Sovereign agent runtime; LOBEs; Switchboard; IsolatedPipeline|
+--------------------------------------------------------------+
|  DIDComm V2  — Transport                                     |
|  SignThenEncrypt; HTTP/2 + mTLS; did:drn Locator DID URLs    |
+--------------------------------------------------------------+
|  W3C DID + VC  — Identity and Trust                          |
|  did:drn method; VTC7 proof sets; IETF-specified             |
+--------------------------------------------------------------+
|  SVRN7 SRC  — Value Layer                                    |
|  Shared Reserve Currency; UTXO; RFC 6962 Merkle log          |
+--------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The DSA is not a blockchain. There is no shared ledger, no consensus protocol, no mining.
Trust is a property of cryptographic identity and standards-based credential exchange
between sovereign agents.

## 2. The Trusted Digital Assistant (TDA)

A TDA is a sovereign runtime — a .NET 8 console application (Generic Host + Kestrel HTTP/2
+ mTLS) that acts on behalf of a citizen or a Society. It has exactly one inbound surface:

```
POST /didcomm   (HTTP/2 + mTLS, DIDComm V2 SignThenEncrypt)
```

All TDA-to-TDA communication is DIDComm. No SMTP, no CalDAV, no gRPC, no public REST API.
The TDA is the boundary of trust: only packed, authenticated DIDComm messages enter or leave.

Internally, the TDA is structured around the PPML Legend 0.25 element types:

| PPML Element      | TDA Component                           | Artefact                            |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Host              | TDA process (Program.cs)                | .NET 8 Generic Host + DI            |
| Runspace Pool     | RunspacePoolManager + IsolatedPipeline  | Shared ISS + per-invocation runspace|
| PowerShell Runspace | Agent scripts (Agent1, Agent2, AgentN) | .ps1 + Switchboard routing          |
| Switchboard       | DIDCommMessageSwitchboard               | ConcurrentDictionary protocol registry |
| LOBE              | PowerShell modules (.psm1)              | .psm1 + .psd1 + .lobe.json          |
| Data Storage      | LiteDB databases                        | LiteDB context class + IXxxStore    |
| Data Access       | Resolvers / caches                      | IXxxResolver + IMemoryCache         |
| Protocol          | Kestrel listener + HttpClient           | KestrelListenerService.cs           |
| Network           | Internet/LAN/P2P                        | Transport configuration             |

Every component is traceable to a diagram element in DSA 0.24 via a derivation trace comment.

---

## 3. Parchment Programming and Consistent Code Generation

This repository is specified and built using **Parchment Programming** (PPML — Parchment
Programming Modeling Language), a diagram-first methodology in which the DSA 0.24 Epoch 0
architecture diagram is the primary specification and all code is derived from it. PPML has
nine core principles (PP-1 through PP-9).

Every source file carries a derivation trace:
```csharp
// Derived from: "DIDComm Message Switchboard" — element type Switchboard — DSA 0.24 Epoch 0 (PPML)
```

**PP-9 Consistent Code Generation** — the most relevant principle for AI-assisted
development — states that two independent AI generators given the same conformant diagram
MUST produce functionally equivalent artefacts. This enables **session independence**: the
diagram alone, without chat history, is sufficient to regenerate any artefact correctly.

For the full treatment of PPML implications for software development — including the
specification artefact inversion, deterministic AI code generation, explicit architectural
change governance, testability traceability, documentation staleness detection, and
scalability with AI capability — see:

## 4. Architecture — DSA 0.24 Epoch 0

### Deployment Topology

```
+-------------------------------------------------------------+
|  Web 7.0 Federation   (ISvrn7Driver)                        |
|  . Federation wallet — sole source of all SVRN7 SRC         |
|  . Global DID method name registry                          |
|  . Supply governance (monotonically increasing)             |
+------------+--------------------+-------------+------------+
             |  DIDComm V2        |             |
      +-------+------+    +-------+------+  +---+----------+
      |  Society A   |    |  Society B   |  |  Society N   |
      |  Citizen TDAs|    |  Citizen TDAs|  |  Citizen TDAs|
      +--------------+    +--------------+  +--------------+
```

Each participant — Federation, Society, and Citizen — operates a TDA. A Society TDA manages
the monetary layer and registry services. A Citizen TDA manages personal identity,
communications, and value exchange.

## 5. TDA Host Runtime

Derived from: "Citizen/Society TDA (Host)" — element type Host — DSA 0.24 Epoch 0 (PPML).

**Inbound**: `POST /didcomm` (Kestrel HTTP/2 + mTLS; body size limit 2 MB; rate-limited: 100 req/s default)
→ `KestrelListenerService.UnpackAsync()` — extracts `Id`, `Type`, `From`, `Body` from plaintext; encrypted messages pass through undecrypted;
  returns 503 + `Retry-After: 5` if EnqueueAsync throws; returns 429 when rate limit exceeded
→ `LiteInboxStore.EnqueueAsync(type, body, fromDid?, wireId?)` — persists to `svrn7-inbox.db`; `wireId = unpacked.Id` (null for encrypted)
→ `DIDCommMessageSwitchboard` — on startup: calls `ResetStuckMessagesAsync()` (recovery) and re-enqueues dead-lettered outbound messages;
  TTL check: messages older than `MaxMessageAgeSeconds` (default 3600s) are dead-lettered before processing;
  routes by `@type` Locator DID URL; **sequential dispatch** (one message at a time — financial correctness;
  prevents read-modify-write races on shared financial state)
→ LOBE cmdlet pipeline (`IsolatedPipeline` — fresh `Runspace` per dispatch, disposed after; invocation timeout: 30s default)

**Outbound**: LOBE returns `OutboundMessage { PeerEndpoint, PackedMessage, MessageType }`
→ `DIDCommMessageSwitchboard.EnqueueOutbound()`
→ `HttpClient` HTTP/2 POST to peer TDA endpoint; retries up to 3 times with exponential backoff (500ms, 1s, 2s)

### Message Identity — Pass-by-Reference

Every inbound message is assigned a TDA resource DID URL at ingestion:

```
did:drn:{networkId}/inbox/msg/{objectId}
```

Example: `did:drn:alpha.svrn7.net/inbox/msg/5f43a2b1c8e9d7f012345678`

The Switchboard passes this DID URL — not the payload — to the LOBE cmdlet pipeline.
LOBEs call `$SVRN7.GetMessageAsync($MessageDid)` to resolve the payload on demand.
This is the pass-by-reference constraint derived from the Data Access arrow in DSA 0.24.

### Dead-Letter Outbox

Failed outbound messages (after retry exhaustion — 3 attempts, exponential backoff) are persisted to `IOutboxStore`
(`LiteOutboxStore` in `svrn7-inbox.db`) for operator inspection and replay.
On startup, the Switchboard re-enqueues pending outbox records from the prior session.

---

## 6. LOBE Registry

LOBEs (Loadable Object Brain Extensions) are PowerShell modules — the cognitive capability
layer of the TDA. Every LOBE ships three files:

```
{Name}.psm1        PowerShell module
{Name}.psd1        PowerShell manifest
{Name}.lobe.json   LOBE descriptor
```

### Standard LOBE Inventory (v0.8.0)

| #  | Module                    | Loading | Protocol families        | Role                        |
|----|---------------------------|---------|--------------------------|-----------------------------|
|  1 | `Svrn7.Common`            | Eager   | —                        | Shared helpers              |
|  2 | `Svrn7.Federation`        | Eager   | transfer/1.0/*, did/1.0/*| DID management, key pairs   |
|  3 | `Svrn7.Society`           | Eager   | transfer/1.0/*, onboard/*| Monetary + identity ops     |
|  4 | `Svrn7.UX`                | Eager   | ux/1.0/*                 | UX adapter, balance updates |
|  5 | `Svrn7.Email`             | JIT     | email/1.0/*              | RFC 5322 over DIDComm       |
|  6 | `Svrn7.Calendar`          | JIT     | calendar/1.0/*           | iCalendar over DIDComm      |
|  7 | `Svrn7.Presence`          | JIT     | presence/1.0/*           | TDA availability status     |
|  8 | `Svrn7.Notifications`     | JIT     | notification/1.0/*       | Typed alert dispatch        |
|  9 | `Svrn7.Onboarding`        | JIT     | onboard/1.0/*            | Citizen registration        |
| 10 | `Svrn7.Invoicing`         | JIT     | invoice/1.0/*            | Invoice-to-payment          |
| 11 | `Svrn7.Identity`          | JIT     | did/1.0/*, vc/1.0/*      | DID Document + VC resolution|

**Eager**: pre-loaded into `InitialSessionState` at TDA startup.
**JIT**: imported on first inbound message of a matching `@type` via `LobeManager.EnsureLoadedAsync()`.

### LOBE Descriptor Format

Each `.lobe.json` declares:
- Protocol URI registrations (`match: "exact"` or `"prefix"`) for Switchboard routing
- MCP-aligned cmdlet definitions with `inputSchema`/`outputSchema` (JSON Schema 2020-12)
- Behavioural `annotations` (`idempotent`, `modifiesState`, `destructive`, `pipelinePosition`)
- `dependencies.lobes` for dependency graph resolution
- `ai` block (`summary`, `useCases`, `compositionHints`, `limitations`)

In a future epoch, the TDA will expose LOBEs as MCP tools via `tools/list` — the descriptor
becomes the MCP tool definition with no translation needed.

### Dynamic Registration

`LobeManager` scans all `*.lobe.json` files at startup (using `SearchOption.AllDirectories`) and watches for
new files via `FileSystemWatcher`. LOBEs live in per-LOBE subfolders under `lobes/` (e.g. `lobes/Svrn7.Common/`).
Third-party LOBEs can be hot-loaded without TDA restart by dropping files into a new subfolder.
If a hot-detected LOBE was configured as eager, it runs as JIT for the current session (a warning is logged;
restart is required for eager loading).

### Pipeline Semantics

```powershell
# Example: citizen onboarding pipeline
Get-TdaMessage -Did $MessageDid |
    ConvertFrom-TdaOnboardRequest |
    Register-Svrn7CitizenInSociety |
    New-TdaOnboardReceipt |
    Send-TdaMessage
```

---

## 7. DIDComm V2 Integration

All TDA-to-TDA communication is DIDComm V2, **SignThenEncrypt** default:

| Mode             | Algorithm                          | Use              |
|------------------|------------------------------------|------------------|
| `Plaintext`      | None                               | Testing only     |
| `Anoncrypt`      | ECDH-ES+A256KW / AES-256-GCM       | Sender anonymous |
| `Authcrypt`      | ECDH-1PU+A256KW / AES-256-GCM      | Authenticated    |
| `SignOnly`       | EdDSA (Ed25519) JWS                | Attestation      |
| `SignThenEncrypt`| JWS inside Anoncrypt JWE           | **Default**      |

### Protocol URI Scheme

All `@type` URIs are **Locator DID URLs** — not `https://` URIs:

```
did:drn:svrn7.net / protocols / transfer / 1.0 / request
+-----------------+ +----------------------------------+
Identity DID        DID URL path (Locator)
(protocol namespace)(specific protocol definition)
```

The SVRN7 ecosystem is intentionally self-contained. Cross-ecosystem interoperability with
non-SVRN7 DIDComm agents is not a goal.

---

## 8. SOVRONA (SVRN7) Shared Reserve Currency

SVRN7 is the value layer of the Web 7.0 DSA — a Shared Reserve Currency (SRC) embedded
within the TDA and governed by a three-epoch monetary lifecycle.

### Units

| Unit    | Value          | Note                           |
|---------|----------------|--------------------------------|
| `grana` | 1              | Smallest unit. All math: long. |
| `SVRN7` | 1,000,000 grana| Display denomination           |

### Epoch Matrix

| Epoch | Name              | Permitted Transfers                              |
|-------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| 0     | Endowment         | Citizen to own Society or Federation only        |
| 1     | Ecosystem Utility | Any citizen to any citizen across any Society    |
| 2     | Market Issuance   | Open-market rules (future)                       |

### Supply and Endowment Chain

```
Federation wallet  (1,000,000,000 SVRN7 at genesis)
    |
    +-- RegisterSocietyAsync()       --> Society wallet  (EndowmentPerSocietyGrana)
            |
            +-- RegisterCitizenAsync() --> Citizen wallet (1,000 SVRN7)
```

Supply conservation is an invariant: total circulating supply always equals
`FederationRecord.TotalSupplyGrana` minus the Federation wallet balance. No synthetic grana
are ever created.

### 8-Step Transfer Validator

| Step | Name                    | Description                                  |
|------|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| 0    | NormaliseDids           | Resolve any DID to primary DID (Society only)|
| 1    | ValidateFields          | Non-null, amount > 0, memo <= 256 chars      |
| 2    | ValidateEpochRules      | Epoch matrix enforcement                     |
| 3    | ValidateNonce           | 24-hour replay window                        |
| 4    | ValidateFreshness       | +/-10 minute timestamp window                |
| 5    | ValidateSanctions       | ISanctionsChecker                            |
| 6    | ValidateSignature       | secp256k1 CESR over canonical JSON           |
| 7    | ValidateBalance         | Dry-run UTXO sum                             |
| 8    | ValidateSocietyMembership | Cross-Society Epoch 1: payee citizenship   |

### Four-Database Design

| Database        | Default file          | Contents                               |
|-----------------|-----------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `svrn7.db`      | `data/svrn7.db`       | Wallets, UTXOs, citizens, Merkle log   |
| `svrn7-dids.db` | `data/svrn7-dids.db`  | DID Documents, version history         |
| `svrn7-vcs.db`  | `data/svrn7-vcs.db`   | Verifiable Credentials, revocations    |
| `svrn7-inbox.db`| `data/svrn7-inbox.db` | Inbox queue, Schema Registry, outbox   |

All paths accept `:memory:` for zero-disk testing.

---

## 9. Identity Model

### Hierarchy

```
Federation (1)
    +-- Societies (N)  -- each with 1..N DID method names
         +-- Citizens (M per Society)  -- each with 1..N DIDs
```

Every participant has exactly one primary DID — the wallet key, immutable.

### Identity DID vs Locator DID URL

Formalised in `draft-herman-did-w3c-drn-00` Section 5a (W3C DID Core Section 3.2):

| Form               | Delimiter | Example                                              | DID Document? |
|--------------------|-----------|------------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| Identity DID       | `:`       | `did:drn:alpha.svrn7.net` (society/federation only)  | Yes           |
| Locator DID URL    | `/`       | `did:drn:alpha.svrn7.net/citizen/alice`         | No            |

Identity DIDs identify subjects. Locator DID URLs address resources. The `:` vs `/` choice
reflects W3C DID Core structural semantics, made explicit as a design principle.

### DID Method Name Lifecycle

```
Never existed --> Active --> Dormant (deregistered) --> Available --> Active (re-registered)
```

Primary method name cannot be deregistered. Existing DIDs under a deregistered method
remain resolvable — deregistration only prevents new issuance.

## 10. Verifiable Credentials

### Credential Types

| Type                                | Issuer     | Subject  | Validity   |
|-------------------------------------|------------|----------|------------|
| `Svrn7EndowmentCredential`          | Society    | Citizen  | 5 years    |
| `Svrn7SocietyRegistrationCredential`| Federation | Society  | Indefinite |
| `Svrn7EpochCredential`              | Federation | Federation| Per epoch |
| `TransferOrderCredential`           | Orig. Society | Payee | 24 hours  |
| `TransferReceiptCredential`         | Recv. Society | Payer  | 24 hours  |

### Lifecycle

```
Active --> Suspended --> Active  (ReinstateVcAsync)
Active --> Revoked              (permanent)
Active --> Expired              (auto-detected on read)
```

Cross-Society VC resolution (`FindBySubjectAcrossSocietiesAsync`) performs a DIDComm
fan-out to all known Societies, returning partial results when some time out.

---

## 11. Merkle Audit Log

All significant state changes are appended to an RFC 6962 SHA-256 Merkle log:

```
Leaf:     SHA-256(0x00 || data)
Internal: SHA-256(0x01 || left || right)
```

Entry types include: citizen/society registration, supply updates, epoch transitions,
transfers (debit/credit/settlement), DID method registration/deregistration, VC revocation,
GDPR erasure. UTXO records and tree heads are retained permanently — deletion is impossible.

---

## 12. GDPR Compliance

`ErasePersonAsync(did, controllerSignature, requestTimestamp)`:

1. Validates controller signature
2. Burns `EncryptedPrivateKeyBase64` to CSPRNG bytes — private key permanently lost
3. Nullifies all PII fields on `CitizenRecord`
4. Deactivates all DID Documents for the citizen
5. Revokes all VCs where citizen is subject
6. Appends `GdprErasure` to Merkle log (non-repudiable proof of erasure)
7. UTXO records retained — required for supply conservation audit

---

## 13. Getting Started — TDA Host

The TDA Host (`Svrn7.TDA`) is a deployable .NET 8 console app, not a NuGet package.

```bash
cd src/Svrn7.TDA
dotnet run
```

`appsettings.json`:

```json
{
  "Tda": {
    "SocietyDid":      "did:drn:alpha.svrn7.net",
    "NetworkId":       "alpha.svrn7.net",
    "LobesConfigPath": "lobes/lobes.config.json",
    "LobeDirectory":   "lobes/",
    "InboxDbPath":     "data/svrn7-inbox.db",
    "HttpPort":        8080,
    "CertificatePath": "certs/tda.pfx"
  }
}
```

---

## 14. Getting Started — Federation Library

```xml
<PackageReference Include="Svrn7.Federation" Version="0.8.0" />
```

```csharp
builder.Services.AddSvrn7Federation(opts =>
{
    opts.FoundationPublicKeyHex  = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("SVRN7_FOUNDATION_KEY")!;

    opts.DidsDbPath   = "data/svrn7-dids.db";
    opts.VcsDbPath    = "data/svrn7-vcs.db";
    opts.DidMethodName           = "web7";
    opts.DidMethodDormancyPeriod = TimeSpan.FromDays(30);
});

// Genesis (run once)
var driver  = app.Services.GetRequiredService<ISvrn7Driver>();
var keyPair = driver.GenerateSecp256k1KeyPair();
// Store keyPair.PrivateKeyBytes in HSM -- never in config

await driver.InitialiseFederationAsync(new InitialiseFederationRequest
{
    Did                      = "did:web7:foundation",
    PublicKeyHex             = keyPair.PublicKeyHex,
    FederationName           = "Web 7.0 Foundation",
    PrimaryDidMethodName     = "web7",
    TotalSupplyGrana         = Svrn7Constants.FederationInitialSupplyGrana,
    EndowmentPerSocietyGrana = 1_000_000 * Svrn7Constants.GranaPerSvrn7,
});
```

---

## 15. Getting Started — Society Library

```xml
<PackageReference Include="Svrn7.Society" Version="0.8.0" />
```

```csharp
builder.Services.AddSvrn7Society(opts =>
{
    opts.SocietyDid    = "did:drn:sovronia";
    opts.FederationDid = "did:drn:foundation";
    opts.DidMethodName  = "sovronia";
    opts.DrawAmountGrana         = 100_000 * Svrn7Constants.GranaPerSvrn7;
    opts.OverdraftCeilingGrana   = 1_000_000 * Svrn7Constants.GranaPerSvrn7;
    opts.SocietyMessagingPrivateKeyEd25519   = societyEd25519PrivKey;
    opts.FederationMessagingPublicKeyEd25519 = federationEd25519PubKey;
    opts.FederationEndpointUrl = "https://federation.svrn7.net/didcomm";
});

// Register a citizen
var driver     = app.Services.GetRequiredService<ISvrn7SocietyDriver>();
var citizenKey = driver.GenerateSecp256k1KeyPair();

await driver.RegisterCitizenInSocietyAsync(new RegisterCitizenInSocietyRequest
{
    Did             = "did:drn:sovronia.svrn7.net/citizen/alice",
    PublicKeyHex    = citizenKey.PublicKeyHex,
    PrivateKeyBytes = citizenKey.PrivateKeyBytes,
    SocietyDid      = "did:drn:sovronia.svrn7.net",
});
// Alice's wallet now contains 1,000 SVRN7 (CitizenEndowmentGrana)
```

## 20. Testing

All tests use LiteDB `:memory:` — no disk I/O, no test isolation issues.

```bash
dotnet test                                    # all 3 projects (167 tests total)
dotnet test tests/Svrn7.Tests/                 # federation (94 tests)
dotnet test tests/Svrn7.Society.Tests/         # society (11 tests)
dotnet test tests/Svrn7.TDA.Tests/             # TDA + LOBE registry (62 tests)
dotnet test --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage"
```

`LobeManagerRegistryTests` covers: `RegisterFromDescriptor` (exact and prefix protocols),
`TryResolveProtocol` (exact beats prefix, longest-prefix wins), epoch gating, idempotency,
`FileSystemWatcher` hot-reload, and `IsRegistered`.

## 23. Roadmap

### v0.8.0 — TDA + LOBE Registry + Architectural Coherence (April 2026) <- *current*
- TDA Host: Kestrel, Switchboard, LobeManager, IsolatedPipeline fully implemented
- **IsolatedPipeline** replaces RunspacePool: per-invocation crash-isolated runspace; shared ISS template
- **Sequential dispatch**: Switchboard processes one inbound message at a time (financial correctness)
- **Startup recovery**: `ResetStuckMessagesAsync()` + outbox re-enqueue on every startup
- **Message TTL**: `MaxMessageAgeSeconds` (default 3600s) dead-letters stale messages before processing
- **Per-message-type retry**: transactional protocols maxAttempts=1 (no retry); non-transactional maxAttempts=3
- **Rate limiting**: `RateLimitRequestsPerSecond` (default 100) on POST /didcomm; HTTP 429 on breach
- **Invocation timeout**: `LobeInvocationTimeoutSeconds` (default 30s); exceeded → `ps.Stop()`
- **Outbound retry**: 3 attempts, exponential backoff (500ms/1s/2s); dead-letter outbox on exhaustion
- **LOBE subdirectory structure**: LOBEs in per-LOBE subfolders; FSW uses `SearchOption.AllDirectories`
- **Graceful shutdown**: `HostOptions.ShutdownTimeout = LobeInvocationTimeoutSeconds + 10s`
- **SwitchboardHostedService restart loop**: 5s backoff on unexpected fault
- Dynamic LOBE registry: `.lobe.json` descriptors + `FileSystemWatcher` hot-reload
- DIDComm protocol URIs: `did:drn:svrn7.net/protocols/...` (Locator DID URLs)
