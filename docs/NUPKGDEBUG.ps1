# Pando.Packaging — JIT LOBE Lifecycle Debug Guide
#
# This guide walks the complete lifecycle of a JIT LOBE: packaging from source,
# validating, installing into a running TDA, verifying hot-load via the
# FileSystemWatcher, triggering the first JIT import, and verifying hot-update.
#
# Pando.Diagnostics is used as the concrete example throughout.  It is the
# simplest LOBE in the repo — one protocol, one cmdlet, no dependencies.
#
# See docs/LOBEDEBUG.ps1 for the federation/society bootstrap sequence that must
# have been completed at least once before sending messages.
#
# ---
#
# Prerequisites
#
# - PowerShell 7 (pwsh.exe).

$PSVersionTable.PSVersion   # Major must be 7

# - The Pando.Packaging module is in tools/Pando.Packaging.psm1 — it is not
#   a LOBE and does not need to be built.  It is imported directly from source.
#
# - A TDA database that already has a federation and society record.
#   If starting fresh, complete Steps 1–4 of docs/LOBEDEBUG.ps1 first.
#
# ---
#
# Terminal layout
#
# Two PowerShell 7 terminals are needed throughout this guide.
#
# | Terminal     | Purpose                                       |
# |--------------|-----------------------------------------------|
# | A — TDA      | Runs the TDA process; watch log output here   |
# | B — tooling  | Runs packaging cmdlets and sends test messages |
#
# ---
#
# Step 1 — Build (Terminal A)

Write-Host "--- Step 1 — Build ---"
Set-Location C:/SVRN7/repos/SVRN7
dotnet build src/Svrn7.TDA/Svrn7.TDA.csproj

# Note: this also runs the "BuildLOBEPackages" MSBuild target (AfterTargets="Build" in
# Svrn7.TDA.csproj), which invokes tools/Build-LOBEPackages.ps1 and packages every LOBE
# under src/Svrn7.TDA/lobes/ (including Pando.Diagnostics) into ./dist/*.nupkg
# automatically. Step 5 below repeats this manually for a single LOBE via New-LOBEPackage
# — that's fine, it just overwrites the same .nupkg — but do not be surprised if
# Pando.Diagnostics.0.1.0.nupkg already exists in ./dist before Step 5 runs.

# ---
#
# Step 2 — Remove the LOBE from the build output (Terminal A)
#
# This simulates a TDA instance that does not yet have Pando.Diagnostics
# installed.  The TDA starts and runs normally without it.

Write-Host "--- Step 2 — Remove the LOBE from the build output ---"
$outDir  = 'src/Svrn7.TDA/bin/Debug/net8.0'
$lobeOut = "$outDir/lobes/Pando.Diagnostics.0.1.0"

if (Test-Path $lobeOut) {
    Remove-Item $lobeOut -Recurse -Force
    Write-Host "Removed $lobeOut"
} else {
    Write-Host "Already absent"
}

# Verify it is gone:

Test-Path $lobeOut   # expected: False

# ---
#
# Step 3 — Start the TDA (Terminal A)

Write-Host "--- Step 3 — Start the TDA ---"

#     JIT       : Svrn7.Email  Svrn7.Calendar  ...
#
# Pando.Diagnostics should not appear in the JIT line.
#
# ---
#
# Step 4 — Load the Pando.Packaging module (Terminal B)
#
# Do this once per PowerShell session.

# Step 6 — Validate (Terminal B)

Write-Host "--- Step 6 — Validate ---"

# Note: Install-LOBEPackage reads the version back out of the package's own .lobe.json
# and names the destination folder "{Name}.{version}", matching the source-tree convention
# used under src/Svrn7.TDA/lobes/ (fixed 2026-08-17 — it previously used the bare package
# ID with no version, e.g. "Pando.Diagnostics").

#
# ---
#
# Step 9 — Verify hot-load: TDA detects the new LOBE (Terminal A)
#
# Within ~200 ms of Step 8 completing, the TDA FileSystemWatcher fires.
# Watch for these log lines in Terminal A:
#
# info: Svrn7.TDA.LobeManager[0]
#       LobeManager: descriptor change —

#
# info: Svrn7.TDA.LobeManager[0]
#       LobeManager: LOBE 'Pando.Diagnostics' v0.1.0 — 2 protocol(s) registered.
#
# If these lines do not appear within 2–3 seconds:
# - Check that the TDA is still running (it may have crashed — look for exceptions).
# - Verify the .lobe.json file is actually on disk (Test-Path in Terminal B).
# - Check TdaOptions.LobesConfigPath in appsettings.json — the lobes dir must
#   match where the package was installed.

# The JIT import succeeded — the LOBE cmdlets are now live in the runspace, which is
# what this step is verifying. The trailing [PS Warning] is expected here: it appears
# because the sender DID has no registered DIDCommMessaging service endpoint in this

# Step 11 — Hot-update: edit the .psm1 and resend (Terminal B)
#
# The TDA uses Import-Module -Force for every JIT message.  Any change to the

#
# Note: Import-Module -Force is called on every JIT message, not only when the file
# changes.  The reimport log line will appear for every dispatch.  This is by design —

# See docs/BACKLOG.md (TDA-001a) if reimport overhead becomes a concern.

# Step 12 — Publish to a local folder feed (optional)

# Troubleshooting
#
# No *.lobe.json found in '...'
#
# New-LOBEPackage -Path must point to the LOBE folder, not the repo root or
# the lobes/ parent.  The folder must contain exactly one *.lobe.json file.

Get-ChildItem .\src\Svrn7.TDA\lobes\Pando.Diagnostics.0.1.0 -Filter '*.lobe.json'
# Must return: Pando.Diagnostics.0.1.0.lobe.json

# Test-LOBEPackage reports FAIL
#
# Read the FAIL line for the specific check.  Common causes:
#
# | FAIL message                                | Cause                                                     |
# |---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
# | Exactly one .nuspec at package root         | Package built incorrectly — re-run New-LOBEPackage        |
# | All tools/ files under single named subfolder | Two or more LOBEs accidentally included                  |
# | .psm1 implementation present                | The .psm1 was not found by Get-ChildItem $lobeDir -File   |
# | SPDX expression is a known value            | lobe.license in .lobe.json is not a recognised SPDX id    |
#
# WARN on .psd1 manifest present is expected for LOBEs that intentionally omit
# a manifest (Pando.Diagnostics, Svrn7.Common).
#
# FSW does not fire after Install-LOBEPackage
#
# 1. Confirm the TDA is still running — an unhandled exception may have stopped it.
# 2. Confirm the install path matches the TDA's lobes directory.
#    The TDA logs the base directory at startup:
#    LobeManager: FileSystemWatcher started — watching 'C:\...\lobes' for *.lobe.json.
#    The Install-LOBEPackage -LobesDirectory value must resolve to the same path.
# 3. On Windows, the FSW has a small buffer — if many files change simultaneously
#    the event may be lost.  Install one LOBE at a time.
#
# no handler for '...' after install
#
# The FSW fired but RegisterFromDescriptor found no valid protocols.
# Check the TDA log for a parse warning:
#
# warn: Svrn7.TDA.LobeManager[0]
#       LobeManager: could not parse descriptor — ...\Pando.Diagnostics.0.1.0.lobe.json.
#
# Validate the .lobe.json is well-formed JSON and the protocols array is
# non-empty.  The uri, match, and entrypoint fields are required per entry.
#
# JIT import fails (Import-Module failed)
#
# InvalidOperationException: LobeManager: Import-Module failed for '...\Pando.Diagnostics.0.1.0.psm1':
#   The term 'Invoke-PandoDiagnosticsDateQuery' is not recognized ...
#
# The .psm1 has a syntax error or the entrypoint function name does not match
# lobe.json.  Open the .psm1 directly and run it in a standalone pwsh session
# to surface parse errors:

pwsh -NoProfile -Command "Import-Module '.\lobes\Pando.Diagnostics.0.1.0\Pando.Diagnostics.0.1.0.psm1' -Force"

# Hot-update: old code still runs
#
# This should not happen — Import-Module -Force runs on every JIT message
# dispatch.  If old code runs after a .psm1 edit:
#
# 1. Confirm the edit was saved to the installed copy in the lobes/ output
#    dir, not just the source copy in src/Svrn7.TDA/lobes/.
# 2. Check the TDA log for 'importing into isolated runspace (JIT)' — if that
#    line is absent the LOBE may have been resolved as eager, which uses
#    -Force false.  Verify Pando.Diagnostics is not in the eager list in
#    lobes.config.json.
