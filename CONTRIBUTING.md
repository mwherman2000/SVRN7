# Contributing to SVRN7

Thank you for your interest in the SOVRONA (SVRN7) Shared Reserve Currency project.

## Methodology

SVRN7 is built using **Parchment Programming** (PPML — Parchment Programming Modeling
Language). All architectural decisions originate in the DSA 0.24 Epoch 0 diagram. Code
is derived from the diagram, not the other way around.

Before contributing code, read the diagram. If a proposed change cannot be traced to a
diagram element, it belongs in a diagram change proposal first.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

Open a GitHub Issue with:
- The version (`v0.8.0`, commit SHA, or date)
- The affected project (`Svrn7.Core`, `Svrn7.Society`, etc.)
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behaviour

### Proposing Changes

1. **Small fixes** (typos, doc corrections, test additions) — open a PR directly.
2. **Behavioural changes** — open an Issue first describing the change and its diagram
   traceability. Reference the DSA version and element instance label.
3. **New LOBEs** — provide a `.lobe.json` descriptor alongside `.psm1` and `.psd1`.
   See `lobes/Svrn7.Email.lobe.json` for the canonical format.
4. **Protocol additions** — new DIDComm `@type` URIs must follow the Locator DID URL
   convention: `did:drn:svrn7.net/protocols/{family}/{version}/{type}` for standard
   SVRN7 protocols, or `did:drn:{your-domain}/protocols/...` for third-party LOBEs.

### Pull Requests

- Target the `main` branch.
- All tests must pass: `dotnet test Svrn7.sln`
- New behaviour requires new tests.
- C# code must target .NET 8 (`net8.0`), use nullable reference types, and follow the
  existing naming conventions (see `README.md` Section 19).
- PowerShell modules must require version 7.0+ (`#Requires -Version 7.0`).
- Each new LOBE must ship `.psm1` + `.psd1` + `.lobe.json`.

## Architecture Constraints

The following are not negotiable in Epoch 0:

- All TDA-to-TDA communication is DIDComm V2, `SignThenEncrypt` mode.
- The TDA's single inbound surface is `POST /didcomm` (Kestrel, HTTP/2 + mTLS).
- No gRPC, no public REST API, no SMTP, no CalDAV.
- Protocol type URIs use `did:drn:svrn7.net/protocols/...` (Locator DID URLs).
- Cross-ecosystem interoperability with non-SVRN7 DIDComm agents is not a goal.
- All persistent state is LiteDB. No external database dependencies.

## Code Style

- C#: standard .NET naming (PascalCase types, camelCase locals, `_camelCase` fields).
- PowerShell: Verb-Noun cmdlet names, `Set-StrictMode -Version Latest`.
- JSON: 2-space indent.
- No tabs anywhere.
